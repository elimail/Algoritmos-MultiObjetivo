abstract = {While logistics research recently has placed increased focus on disruption management, few studies have examined the response and recovery phases in post-disaster operations. We present a multiple objective, integrated network optimisation model for making strategic decisions in the supply distribution and network restoration phases of humanitarian logistics operations. Our model provides an equity-based solution for constrained capacity, budget and resource problems in post-disaster logistics management. We conduct designed experiments for this NP-hard problem to analyse important aspects of the integrated problem for both small- and large-sized networks: full vs. partial restoration and pooled vs. separate budgeting approach. Finally, we apply the model to a Hazus-generated regional case study based on an earthquake scenario and generate efficient Pareto frontiers to understand the trade-off between the objectives of interest.},

We present a goal programming-based multiple-objective integrated response and recovery model to investigate strategic supply distribution and early-stage network restoration decisions. The model prescribes equity- or fairness-based compromise solutions for user-desired goals, given limited capacity, budget, and available resources. An experimental study demonstrates how different decision making strategies can be formulated to understand important dimensions of decision making. The efficient frontiers are generated to understand the trade-off between objectives and to analyze capacity-related planning strategies.

abstract = {Every year, hundreds of thousands of people are affected by natural disasters. The number of casualties is usually increased by lack of clean water, food, shelter, and adequate medical care during the aftermath. One of the main problems influencing relief distribution is the state of the post-disaster road network. In this paper, we consider the problem of scheduling the emergency repair of a rural road network that has been damaged by the occurrence of a natural disaster. This problem, which we call the Network Repair Crew Scheduling and Routing Problem addresses the scheduling and routing of a repair crew optimizing accessibility to the towns and villages that demand humanitarian relief by repairing roads. We develop both an exact dynamic programming (DP) algorithm and an iterated greedy-randomized constructive procedure to solve the problem and compare the performance of both approaches on small- to medium-scale instances. Our numerical analysis of the solution structure validates the optimization model and provides managerial insights into the problem and its solutions.},

abstract = {The distribution of emergency goods to a population affected by a disaster is one of the most fundamental operations in Humanitarian Logistics. In the case of a particularly disruptive event, parts of the distribution infrastructure (e.g., bridges, roads) can be damaged. This damage would make it impossible and/or unsafe for the vehicles to reach all the centers of demand (e.g., towns and villages). In this paper, we propose and solve the problem of planning for recovery of damaged elements of the distribution network, so that the consequent distribution planning would benefit the most. We apply the model, called RecHADS, to a case study based on the 2010 Haiti earthquake. We also show empirically the importance of coordinating recovery and distribution operations optimization. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This study aims to present a framework for effective disaster debris management for a resilient community. The framework consists of a Geographical Information System (GIS) and system dynamics to assess debris removal performance. GIS was used to conduct a land suitability analysis for a temporary debris management site and system dynamics were applied to evaluate the debris removal performance in different scenarios. This systemic approach and quantitative analysis enable a decision maker to gain insights into the inter-relationship between critical infrastructure and resources, the effectiveness of temporary debris management sites, and the debris removal performance. Also, a debris management team would have benefits from the framework by being able to (1) understand dynamic behaviors of debris removal operation, (2) evaluate the existing debris management plan, and (3) set up multiple strategies for optimal debris removal operations under different disaster-impact scenarios.},

abstract = {Urban transportation infrastructure networks are highly sensitive to natural disasters yet critical for the success of rescue, recovery and renovation operations; as such, prompt restoration of such networks becomes of critical importance for disaster relief services. Interestingly, while fund allocation in infrastructure management has been extensively studied in the literature, most studies have focused on regular ?scheduled? repair, maintenance and rehabilitation actions, largely ignoring fund allocation in emergency situations, a topic of considerable interest in practice. The present paper proposes a methodology for optimally allocating funds for repairing an urban infrastructure network following natural disasters using a three-stage genetic algorithm based approach. The methodology is tested with data from Athens, Greece, a densely populated urban area highly prone to earthquakes and with an extensive bridge network. Results indicate that the methodology proposed provides fast and reliable results that can be very useful in fund allocation decisions following natural disasters.},

abstract = {Post-disaster waste management is one of the most important operational management systems that have been developed to help affected communities recover and restore conditions back to a stable situation after a disaster. An effective post-disaster waste management strategy still needs to be further developed for optimum efficiency. Hence, this paper aims to present the developed system of post-disaster waste supply chain management strategy (PWSCM) along with the integrated decision-making system for the on-site and off-site separation of recyclable materials. A mathematical model of mixed-integer linear programming is proposed in which the objective aims are to minimize the financial effects through assessment of the fixed costs and variable costs, RSR (Reduction, Separation and Recycling) costs, and the penalty costs associated with the negative environmental and human effects of post-disaster scenarios and to maximize revenue from any sellable waste. The proposed model considers all networks in the debris operation process that consists of waste collection and separation sites, processing and recycling sites, disposal sites and market sites. Moreover, the RSR technologies have also been considered in the proposed model. Due to the limitations of competence of an exact solution method for such a large problem, this study also presents two effective metaheuristic approaches with particular encoding and decoding schemes; Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE) to solve PWSCM. Finally, the numerical tests for PWSCM improvement will be discussed. The performance of the proposed PWSCM improvement system was superior to both the on-site separation model and the off-site separation model.},

@article{Akbari2017,
abstract = {After a natural disaster roads can be damaged or blocked by debris, while bridges and viaducts may collapse. This commonly observed hazard causes some road sections to be closed and may even disconnect the road network. In the immediate disaster response phase work teams are dispatched to open a subset of roads to reconnect the network. Closed roads are traversable only after they are unblocked/cleared by one of the teams. The main objective of this research is to provide an efficient solution method to generate a synchronized work schedule for the road clearing teams. The solution should specify the synchronized routes of each clearing team so that: 1) connectivity of the network is regained, and 2) none of the closed roads are traversed unless their unblocking/clearing procedure is finished. In this study we develop an exact Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation to solve this problem. Furthermore, we propose a matheuristic that is based on an MIP-relaxation and a local search algorithm. We prove that the optimality gap of the relaxation solution is bounded by K times the lower bound obtained from the relaxed model, where K is the number of teams. We show computationally that the matheuristic obtains optimal or near-optimal solutions.},
